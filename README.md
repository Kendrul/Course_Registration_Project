# Course_Registration_Project
Authors: Robert Plantilla, Emile Dulguerov, Jason Schneider

A project to create a course registration software, that we called PeopleSofter ("The Softest soft"). It offers Course Registration for Students, and some admin options for faculty.

Coded in C# utilizing Windows Visual Studio. This project was designed and focused on an Interface-first design principle. As such, back-end implementation such as databases are not existent, and overall bare-bones in design/implementation.
